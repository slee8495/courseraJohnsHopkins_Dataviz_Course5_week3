## Weakness

-   It is difficult to compare the different figures and to assess which flows contributed the most to the cumulative values.

-   The date on the top right is not too readable

## Strength

-   Fascinating animation catches reader's eyes

-   Clear Title to explain what this chart is about

-   Great labeling to the plots

-   The animation enabled to show in one figure the flow by the time
